description: Apply to the Shared Housing Solution Housing Model
---
People want to spend their money in a meaningful way to impact society.   As social-preneurs, we are impacting people in need of housing by providing single family homes and apartments.  

Shared Housing Solutions is the umbrella organization of Kate’s House Foundation; www.kateshousefoundation.org (501C3 EIN;  81-4323129), founded in Seattle, Washington by **Dr. Sherri Candelario** and **Frank Candelario** in 2015.   We were founded to eliminate housing insecurity for men and women who are not able to easily obtain housing.  **As the founders and visionaries** behind Kate’s House Foundation, we **created** the first homes in Washington state to be certified as Level II Medically Assisted Treatment homes by the Washington Affiliate of Quality Residences.  Our model of housing can be duplicated for any population of people.  **For investors, you own the real estate, receive a great return and provide a model of housing that works!**

Our clients are **men and women with justice issues, veterans, people in recovery, foster kids, mothers, students, aging in place, and people in drug court.**  Most have experienced homelessness. This is the first opportunity to live in a safe neighborhood in a beautiful home.  Many are dual diagnosis.  We partner with external counselors and physicians in a wholistic model to change how people are housed and served.

Our model of **sustainable recovery housing** upended the typical model of recovery housing.  We do not operate by grants or endowments.  Instead, **we have renewable contracts with state and local governments,** tapping into **billions** of dollars in federal grants.

We are in great and safe neighborhoods.  Our houses are appreciating, the government is paying our expenses and our people are thriving.  Win, win, win.

Sherri Candelario, Ph.D.  is a pharmacologist from University of Washington Medical School and the founding patent counsel for numerous biotech companies. Dr. Candelario has published in peer reviewed publications on mechanisms of opioids.

Frank Candelario has run non-profit camps, had a long career in international marketing and  is a real estate broker and develops the real estate to provide homes.  

Together, we used our skills in medicine and real estate to create a sustainable model of shared housing to provide group support for people in need of housing to foster independence.

**Together, we have successfully taught and mentored real estate investors around the US on how to develop shared housing models.  Our goal is to use real estate to end housing insecurity.**

Sherri and Frank were founding members of the Washington state affiliate of the National Alliance of Recovery Residences (*www.narronline.org*)  to bring national standards to Washington state in 2018.   Sherri is on the Board of Directors.   Frank inspects homes for WAQR for certification.   In 2019, WAQR advocated and passed state legislation that mandates all homes that receive state funds to house people in recovery or from the justice system meet national standards.  WAQR provides monthly training to housing providers on fair housing, insurance and recovery models.  Sherri is a frequent instructor.

Our model is beautiful homes in safe, secure neighborhoods with community support.  We have eliminated housing insecurity for some of the most vulnerable members of society.

Our homes have been toured by the NYC team at the Second Chance Act, local congressional staff and the military coordinator for Senator Patty Murray. Our goal is to change how housing is provided in the US for vulnerable populations with a vision toward recovery, jobs and permanent housing.  We have served 300 people in the past five years.
