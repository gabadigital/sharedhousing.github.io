Frank and Sherri Candelario, Ph.D. had a dream of ending housing insecurity for the vulnerable. They realized that the private sector can buy real estate  and have the house payments made by state and federal dollars.

**By placing men and women in great neighborhoods, they created a paradigm shift on how to change the trajectory of an individual’s life story.**

Sherri Candelario, Ph.D.  received her degree from University of Washington Medical School and authored several pioneering research papers on how opioids work in the brain. She is the founding patent counsel for numerous biotech companies that have gone public.

Frank Candelario had a long career in international marketing and branding. He is a real estate broker and investor.  Together they use housing to change lives.

In 2015, the Candelarios **saw the need to set a national standard for sober homes.** They saw first-hand how a lack of standards and substandard housing providers harmed people in recovery. Unregulated sober homes have been around for 50 years. **They said “we can do better”.**

Frank and Sherri own several million dollars of single-family homes in Seattle where they have housed more than 500 people over the past six years as founders of Kate's House Foundation.   ([www.kateshousefoundation.org](http://kateshousefoundation.org/))

**Our clients are veterans, people in recovery, justice involved, foster kids and under served women.   All have one thing in common:  a desire to live in a great home in a safe neighborhood.**

**To make real change, that starts in the legislature.  They helped form the Washington State affiliate (WAQRR) in 2017.  WAQRR  subscribes to national standards for sober homes created in 2011 by the national accreditation agency (NARR).**

**Sherri sits on the advisory board to the legislature.  In this role they passed legislation that prevents grants and tax funding going to non-accredited homes.**  Recently, they were on the forefront of a large fund to start new sober homes.  **Their homes were the first Medically Assisted Treatment homes in Washington state.**

**Notably, they have spoken and trained people all over the country to copy their model of superior shared housing that is funded by government contracts.**

They have trained 1000s of people in the US on their real estate model and are making societal change, one house at a time.
