### Our Mission:  We house people who deserve good homes in shared housing:   veterans, women, moms, the elderly and foster kids.

Our services include locating and identifying properties in neighborhoods that are undervalued but stable. We work with investors from Washington and the US and help them locate prime properties that will start or grow their real estate portfolios. Shared Housing Solutions is here to help you with your real estate investment with expertise in how to develop certified shared housing models.

As soon as the property is ready, we screen and identify the best residents to occupy the house, minimizing losses from openings and making sure there’s a steady stream of income. At any time, we have contracts with state and local agencies, the Veterans Administration and local drug courts to provide residents.

* **The problem:**  There is a lack of affordable housing for some of the most deserving members of society.  
* **How does an investor achieve high returns** using a model of socially responsible investing?
* Can an investor make a difference in society by investing in professionally managed single-family homes?
* The investor is solving the problem of housing veterans, disadvantaged women and people in recovery achieving triple returns provided by contracts with federal and state governments.
* Shared Housing Solutions mission:   We are **social-preneurs** providing shared housing in single family homes in escalating neighborhoods.  We own the homes.   The state and federal government pays the mortgage and expenses.



### WHY SINGLE FAMILY HOMES?

* We were surprised to find that the demand for shared housing during the “stay at home” orders increased significantly.
* Air BNB and vacation rentals sit empty as state and local governments want to limit visitors to prevent community spread.
* The prisons and hospitals opened their doors and asked us to take as many people as possible. **These people were pre-screened for success** by the counselors in these institutions. We were pre-paid monthly fees from **$700 a person to $850** a person. We house two people in a bedroom.
* Many people make significant returns in a down real estate market. We learned that our contracts would stretch to as many houses that we could provide.
* A single-family home’s value to an investor is the rent that it provides. Market competition can lead to low returns.
* We use density (two beds per bedroom 4-5 bedrooms for a house for 8 to ten beds to double or triple cash flow.
* We buy a great house in a high value neighborhood resulting in superior cash flow and appreciation.
* Single family homes are easy to market and exit.
