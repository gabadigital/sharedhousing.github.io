### Our Mission:  We house people who deserve good homes in shared housing:   veterans, women, moms, the elderly and foster kids.

Our services include locating and identifying properties in neighborhoods that are undervalued but stable. We work with investors from Washington and the US and help them locate prime properties that will start or grow their real estate portfolios. Shared Housing Solutions is here to help you with your real estate investment with expertise in how to develop certified shared housing models.

As soon as the property is ready, we screen and identify the best residents to occupy the house, minimizing losses from openings and making sure thereâ€™s a steady stream of income. At any time, we have contracts with state and local agencies, the Veterans Administration and local drug courts to provide residents.

### WHY SINGLE FAMILY HOMES

* **The problem:**  There is a lack of affordable housing for some of the most deserving members of society.  
* **How does an investor achieve high returns** using a model of socially responsible investing?
* Can an investor make a difference in society by investing in professionally managed single-family homes?
* The investor is solving the problem of housing veterans, disadvantaged women and people in recovery achieving triple returns provided by contracts with federal and state governments.
* Shared Housing Solutions mission:   We are **social-preneurs** providing shared housing in single family homes in escalating neighborhoods.  We own the homes.   The state and federal government pays the mortgage and expenses.
