* We use density (two beds per bedroom 4-5 bedrooms for a house for 8 to ten beds to double or triple cash flow.

* This type of shared housing is not constrained by landlord tenant laws.  It is a program.
* Single family homes are easy to market and exit.

* Solve homelessness
* Ends Poverty
* Recovery assistance
* Counters inequality

* The prisons and hospitals opened their doors and asked us to take as many people as possible.   These people were pre-screened for success by the counselors in these institutions.  We were pre-paid monthly fees from $700 a person to $850 a person.  We house two people in a bedroom.
* Many people make significant returns in a  down real estate market.   We learned that our contracts would stretch to as many houses that we could provide.
