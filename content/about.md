### WHY SINGLE FAMILY HOMES

* The problem:  There is a lack of affordable housing for some of the most deserving members of society.  
* How does an investor achieve high returns using  a model of socially responsible investing?
* Can an investor make a difference in society by investing in professionally managed single-family homes?
* The investor is solving the problem of housing veterans, disadvantaged women and people in recovery achieving triple returns provided by contracts with federal and state governments.
* Shared Housing Solutions mission:   We are social-preneurs providing shared housing in single family homes in escalating neighborhoods.  We own the homes.   The state and federal government pays the mortgage and expenses.
* Saves taxpayer money
* Taps billions of dollars in federal funding for housing programs
* We were surprised to find that the demand for shared housing during the “stay at home” orders increased significantly.
* Air BNB and vacation rentals sit empty as state and local governments want to limit visitors to prevent community spread.
* The prisons and hospitals opened their doors and asked us to take as many people as possible.   These people were pre-screened for success by the counselors in these institutions.  We were pre-paid monthly fees from $700 a person to $850 a person.  We house two people in a bedroom.
* Many people make significant returns in a  down real estate market.   We learned that our contracts would stretch to as many houses that we could provide.
