### WHY SINGLE FAMILY HOMES
* **The problem:**  There is a lack of affordable housing for some of the most deserving members of society.  
* **How does an investor achieve high returns** using a model of socially responsible investing?
* Can an investor make a difference in society by investing in professionally managed single-family homes?
* The investor is solving the problem of housing veterans, disadvantaged women and people in recovery achieving triple returns provided by contracts with federal and state governments.
* Shared Housing Solutions mission:   We are **social-preneurs** providing shared housing in single family homes in escalating neighborhoods.  We own the homes.   The state and federal government pays the mortgage and expenses.
